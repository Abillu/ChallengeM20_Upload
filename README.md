# Joint Savings Account Smart Contract

## Overview 

This blockchain technology uses Solidity to create a smart contract. The smart contract automates the creation of joint saving account that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account whose features consists of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.


## Methodology and Approach
  * Set up a local blockchain development environment

  * Build a smart contract by using Solidity

  * Implement functions in the smart contract to transfer and withdraw funds

  * Deploy a smart contract in an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

 
## Libraries and Technologies Used

- Remix IDE

- Solidity -programming language for creating and deploying the smart contract

- Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)- a software platform offering an isolated environment in which Solidity code can run


## Results 

The deposit and withdrawal transactions, which were designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected. The images confirming this are contained in the folder Execution_results.
